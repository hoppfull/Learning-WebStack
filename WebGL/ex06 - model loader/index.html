		External style sheet is used only to make page easier on the eyes while developing (with black background and grey frame around canvas).
		JQuery is used for convenience and in later steps helps with loading resources and keeping code clean.
		glMatrix is used for convenience with managing matrices, more on this later...
		
		The idea is to keep engine stuff inside a separate file (with dummy name "My3DEngine.js" for now)
